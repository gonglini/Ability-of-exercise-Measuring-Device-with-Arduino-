When running, it shows the average speed and time taken for each section and displays the final average speed and time taken on a serial monitor
The main purpose of this study is to accurately measure running in institutions such as schools by carefully analyzing the results of exercise 
in order to obtain more detailed and accurate results than the existing primary results, presenting them as a single statistic, and making them easier to see. 
In addition, athletes in running events can check what they need to supplement through this app and analyze how to run 
(ex. which section should run faster) to develop good habits or help them correct their posture.
